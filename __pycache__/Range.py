# Ranges in python have a signature to perform each.

# Range (stop) -----------> This is a stop Range
# Range (start,stop) -----------> This have start and stop range
# Range (start,stop,step) -----------> This contains a start and stop value along with the step function.

# By default python will have the range from zero.
print(range(5))

# You can declare the range with start and stop values. 
print(range(5,10))

# You can convert the range to list with listOf(:_)
print(list(range(5,10)))
